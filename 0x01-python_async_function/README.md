## Python Async Function

This directory contains the code and resources for the Python Async Function project.

**Async Functions** are used to create functions that can be run asynchronously.
This means that the function can be run in the background while the rest of the program continues to run.

### Topics Covered

- **Async Functions**: We learn how to create functions that can be run asynchronously. This means that the function can be run in the background while the rest of the program continues to run.

- **Await**: We learn how to use the `await` keyword to wait for an asynchronous function to finish running. This means that the program will wait for the asynchronous function to finish running before continuing to run.

- **Async Libraries**: We learn how to use the `asyncio` library to create asynchronous functions.
