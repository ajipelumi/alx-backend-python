## Variable Annotations

This directory contains the code and resources for the Variable Annotations project.

**Variable Annotations** are used to declare the type of a variable in Python.
They are used to inform the developer of the type of data that should be stored in a variable.
They are also used by type checkers to verify that the correct type of data is being stored in a variable.

### Topics Covered

- **Variable Annotations**: We learn how to declare the type of a variable in Python.

- **Type Checking**: We learn how to use type checkers to verify that the correct type of data is being stored in a variable.

- **Type Checking with mypy**: We learn how to use the `mypy` type checker to verify that the correct type of data is being stored in a variable.

- **Duck Typing and Generics**: We learn how to use duck typing and generics to declare the type of a variable in Python.
